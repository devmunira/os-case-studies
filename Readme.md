**Bulk Image Processing for a Photography Website**

A website allows users to upload hundreds of high-resolution images at once. Each image needs to be resized to multiple resolutions and watermarked before being saved and shown in the gallery. The site should remain responsive and fast during heavy usage.

**Customer Invoice Emailer**

On the first day of the month, invoice emails are to be sent to all customers who placed orders today. The list may contain thousands of users. Admins expect feedback about success/failure per email.

**Hotel Room Reservation API**

Users browse available hotel rooms and make reservations. If a room is shown as available, it must not be double-booked. Availability should be accurate and booking must be reliable.
